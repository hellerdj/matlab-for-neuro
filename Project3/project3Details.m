%Show two conditions (pop-out search versus conjunction search
%With four levels each (set size = 4, 8, 12, 16). These conditions can be 
%blocked (first all pop-out searches, then all conjunction searchs, etc.)

%Randomly interleave trials with and without target. 
%Number of trials with and without target must be equal

%Number of green and red stimuli is balanced in conjunction search
%Should be (50 50)
%Make sure there is an equal number of x and o elements, if possible

%Use only correct trials (subject indicated no target present when no
%target was presented or indicated target present when it was present) for
%the analysis. 

%Try to be as quick as possible while making sure to be right. 
%You do not want a Speed/accuracy tradeoff in your data

%The analysis should contain at least 20 correct trials per level and
%condition for a total of 160 trials. 
%Each trial should go quickly (about 1 second each) 

%Pick two keys on the keyboard to indicate repsonses 
%one for target present, one for target absent - like h275

%Report and graph the mean reaction times for correct trials as a function
%of pop-out search versus conjunction search 
%and for trials where the target is present versus target is absent
%Hence you need between two and four figures
%You can combine graphs for copmarison (see below) 

%Report the Pearson correlation coefficients between reaction time and set
%size and indicate whether it is significant or not (for each condition) 

%Make a qualitative assessment of the slopes in the different conditions 
%(we will talk about curve fitting in a later chapter)

%Hits: 
%Start writing one trial and make sure it works properly 
%Be aware that you effectively have an experimental design with 
%three factors: [Set size: 4 levels (4, 8, 12, 15), 
%conjunction versus feature search: 2 levels, 
%target present versus absent: 2 levels).

%It might make sense to block the first two factors and randomize the last
%one
